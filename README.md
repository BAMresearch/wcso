## WeChemSyn Ontology (WCSO)

The Wet-Chemical Syntheses (WeChemSyn) Ontology (WCSO) provides a semantic framework for the structured representation of knowledge related to the production of (nano)particles by wet chemical synthesis. Developed at the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM) / Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing in Berlin, Germany, WCSO supports the formalization, integration, and consistent reuse of wet chemical synthesis descriptions and nanoparticle-related data across experimental workflows, synthesis processes, and Self-Driving Labs.

WCSO builds upon the [PMD Core Ontology (PMDco)](https://github.com/materialdigital/core-ontology), a mid-level ontology developed within the Platform MaterialDigital (PMD) project and grounded in the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). By adhering to BFO as its foundational ontology, WCSO ensures semantic interoperability with a wide range of BFO-aligned ontologies and knowledge graphs, both within and beyond the materials science and engineering domain, thereby supporting data-driven and automated research workflows.

Technical documentation of the ontology is available at:
